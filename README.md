# MicroLoans

Microloans is a contract for **blockchain** based **peer-to-peer lending**. 

<p>    
The platform will be based on the <strong>permissionless</strong> and <strong>public</strong> <strong>Ethereum blockchain</strong>, making it available to everyone who meets the requirement to enter and produce transactions. The platform is entirely decentralized and transparent for every user who joins the pool. To be more precise, we can resemble our platform with a <strong>crowdfunding contract</strong> that gives everyone equal access to join and make changes on the chain. 
The aim for this platform is to create an environment where medium/small-sized businesses can afford micro-loans thanks to the peer risk-free network. This, in the historical financial world, has always been avoided, due to high costs and the risks related to the present asymmetries is needed. Clients asking for small, short-term loans have historically been excluded due to the high fixed costs associated with transaction fees and administrative ones. The cost of acquiring clients compared to the size of the loan is drastically higher in microfinance compared to regular commercial loans, and the profits returning from these small transactions, including the acquisition of a customer, don’t compensate for the risks associated with the asymmetries with this practice and the relative costs. The solution we proposed to this problem lays in adopting blockchain, due to the benefits this decision would lend to the platform.</p>

## Why blockchain? 
The financial sector has increasingly started to look to blockchain technology to innovate various products and services. However, as with any new technology with the potential to disrupt an industry, it is important to explicitly state where value is derived from when adopting the new tech. Following are certain inherent properties of this smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain from which our product benefit.

>	1. Immutable
>> <ul> 
>> <li> One of the most prominent challenges one encounters when engaging in lending agreements is to assess risks associated with the transaction. The lender requires assurance that the terms on the agreement will be respected by both parties. Blockchain technology ultimately mitigates some of the risks commonly associated with contractual agreements. In fact, on chains like Ethereum, it’s possible to regulate accords between different parties with programmable rules through smart contracts. This computer protocol allows parties who may not fully trust each other (like in our context of microlending) to execute and verify the provisions of a contract without relying on the services of any trusted third intermediaries. The terms are previously written in code, and once the requirements are fulfilled, the contract is automatically executed. Each participant engage with a solid contract with conditions that cannot be altered ex post. The immutability of this contract represents a crucial feature, as it allows for a trustless and permissionless system. 

>	2. Visible
>> <ul>
>> <li> The promise of this prototype is synonymous with the emerging DeFi paradigm. Namely, to reduce the need of financial intermediaries. The intermediaries are driven by a profit incentive, and to limit the negative exposure conditional to lending capital, these intermediaries gather information about their clients. The nature of the information often comes in to question in terms of discrimination, as discrepancies in credit distribution are observed on local levels. This smart contract aims to put the users in the center, and subsequently allow for transparency to reduce moral hazards in lending. In our case, these properties of the blockchain are essentials in order to guarantee a series of certainties and insurances to the peers in the network: with this technology, we will be able to ensure maximum transparency to the money lenders, which will be able to rely on the decentralized record of the transaction (distributed ledger), open to everyone.

>	3. Permissionless
>> <ul>
>> <li> Historically, banks typically has constituted the preferred vehicle for lending. However, long-standing issues regarding lending discrimination raises the question whether there is a more publicly efficient way of allocating credit. By focusing notably toward smaller communities, this contract aims to benefit groups with previous difficulties in obtaining financing. Thus, access is not restricted by any means. Anyone is able to use this contract as expressed in code.

To conclude, the unique features of the Ethereum Blockchain perfectly aligns with the purpose of this smart contract. The immutability and visibility will allow for a trustless transaction between actors, while the social aspect of recommenders is expected to help enforce the contract. 

For this reason, we introduced a blockchain solution that focuses on allowing to grant microloans through the consent from previous members who are accountable for the borrower. Indeed, an individual can submit a loan request only through the approval of other <strong>four members</strong>. These act as guarantors and are responsible for the non-repayment of loans of the new entrant, and eventually have to split the loan between them if the borrower defaults. More specifically, their deposits are temporarely blocked when this event occurs, and they are later available when the borrower repays. Hence, the mechanism of introducing peer pressure through guarantor’s accountability allows requesting loans without providing any <strong>collateral</strong>.
</div>
In the beginning, the service is indeed thought to be used by minorities, but we believe that through <strong>network effect</strong>, such service will increase its value once it reaches critical mass and will hence start having more and more consumers, which will abandon the traditional bank’s bureaucracies and interest rates.
On the other side, lenders would benefit by not having third parties involved ensuring higher benefits due to short-term loans with less interest. Indeed, a bank would not be needed to overcome asymmetric information, since the loan repayment would be guaranteed through the four network peers. Hence through this solution, it is possible to invest in a low-effort way and short term, so that lenders will not be tied up for a long period of time, while gaining higher returns than alternative solutions such as regular saving accounts.

## Financial Inclusion

The aim is to create an environment in which every individual that is considered unable to get a loan due to low income or low credit-liability score will be free from the dependency on traditional banks. In this sense, our idea is also oriented towards tackling extreme poverty by providing accessible financial instruments such as micro loans. Indeed, our project falls into a bigger theme in finance, which is increasingly gaining importance: financial inclusion.
<p>
Financial Inclusion is defined as the “ease of access, availability and usage of the formal financial system by all members of the economy” (Sarma, 2008).
One of the main indicators of financial inclusion is the possibility for individuals to hold a personal financial account.
As of 2018, 1.7 billion adults were unbanked globally, of which 56% were women, and 50% fell into the poorest 40 percent of households in the economy, according to the Global Findex Database 2017 (Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2018). The paper also provides the main reasons for not holding a financial institution account, the first being too little money to start an account, the second distance or cost, and lastly having another family member already holding an account. Moreover, clients asking for small, short-term loans have been historically excluded from traditional bank services because of the high costs associated with them and the disincentives for companies to offer short-term solutions for limited amounts (Hoffmann 2021). Financial inclusion is beneficial for both the single individual and the society at a macro level. Omar (2020) proves that financial inclusion contributes to the reduction of poverty rates and income inequality in developing countries.</p>
<p>
Moreover, as evidenced in Levine (2005), financial inclusion has a positive impact on the economy as a whole through the production of information, allocation of capital, monitoring of investment, mobilization of savings, and facilitation of trading. According to Barajas (2020), greater financial inclusion is positively correlated with greater financial development and control for the level of financial depth.
A positive improvement to financial inclusion can be driven by fintech development, which offers new ways to expand the inclusion and paves the way for new forms of financial profiling for poor households (Gabor, 2017).
In particular, blockchain technology can, directly and indirectly, positively impact financial inclusion, especially through the reduction of costs for opening checking accounts (Dragos 2017).</p>

## Competitors
<p>
As of the current landscape, different solutions are available in the market. The competitors can be mainly divided into two broad categories: blockchain-based lending platforms and peer-to-peer structure.</p>
Blockchain-based lending platforms are companies such as <strong>SALT</strong> and <strong>BlockFi</strong> that offer cash loans leveraging on digital assets, i.e. Bitcoin, Ether or Dogecoin. While being able to lower the financial fees and avoiding having an impact on the borrower’s credit score, such a structure is in practice performing banking activities without regulations or license. Our platform, on the other hand, allows users to access funding opportunities without the need to provide any financial collateral, whether it be a traditional one or cryptocurrencies, like in our competitor’s case. Hence, their lending mechanism wouldn’t solve our target’s specific problems.
<p>
On the other hand, peer-to-peer lending platforms such as <strong>Liquid Mortgage</strong> fail to provide significant and sustainable incentives for the service. The Liquid Mortgage platform directly connects borrowers with lenders. The latter have smart contract abilities and real-time transaction data. However, we foresee a substantial issue when considering its ability to scale: if anonymity is guaranteed, the matching between lenders and borrowers would be frictious.</p>
 
## Revenue streams 
 
So far, the first thing in order to guarantee future revenues is to create the largest network possible. Thus, we can’t foresee any income for the first period of activity, and won’t apply any intermediary fees to anyone joining the network. We may even need to guarantee ourselves for the loan transactions, since in the first phase, lenders could be reluctant to act as guarantors for some unknown peers.
After having reached a critical mass point for the network, beyond which we think the system will go ahead by itself, we might start thinking about applying fees to the interests of the lenders, which will be our main revenues. Then, we could start thinking about some parallel incomes, such as lending ourselves loans and cashing out the whole interests part.
We may even think about selling our blockchain- and smart contract-based solution to retail banks which miss this microloans technology in their revenue stream. The service can be made available in a “cost-effective, safe and scalable manner, unlike the currently existing - and oftentimes unlawful - payday loans” (Hoffmann, 2021).
 
## Architecture
 
1. New members enter the network and are admitted into the group of borrowers if validated by other four existing members. Other memebers, who act solely as lenders, can enter directly. 
2. Users deposit money in the pool and can withdraw the interest generated from it every three months.
3. Borrowers can request money from the pool if they were sponsored by four existing members when entering the network and if they deposited some amount of money in the pool. Moreover - since the amount requested is covered by the overall deposits of the four recommenders - when money is transfered to the borrower, one fourth of the amount is blocked in the deposits of each recommender and is made available for them to withdraw when the loan is repaied by the borrower.


## Perspectives and future developments: Credit system & Social features

> 1. **Automize credit system**
>>    <ul>
>>    To motivate active usage and give credit record reference for other financial institutes, credit system could be introduced based on user’s behavior. Rules for example:
>>      <ul>
>>  <li> Collection:
>>    <ul>
>>   <li>Earn credit point after successful loan, for both borrower and recommender </li>
>>    <li>Earn point for sharing MicroLoan activities on social media and for new member invitation</li>
>>    <li>Extra point for being both trustful borrower and responsible recommender</li>
>>    <li>Extra point if accumulated amount and frequency reached certain level​</li>
>>    <li>Extra point if invited members reached certain level of frequent activities</li>
>>    </ul>
>>  <li> Function:
>>    <ul>
>>    <li>Credit points can be used for customer tier identification, and therefore slightly tiered interest pricing, and more payback mode options</li>
>>    <li>In tier groups, adjust loan request priorities, mainly focus on poor credit user in the system</li>
>>    </ul>
>>  <li> Technically:
>>    <ul>
>>    <li>Introduce a new balance for credit points, with functions of plus, minus, cluster into tiers, rank in each tier.</li>
>>    <ul>
 



> 2. **Optimize social features**
>>    <ul>
>>    Social features could lead to more diverse user groups, and customize their own type of financial aids, either charitable or profit-oriented.
>>      <ul>
>>  <li> Introduce social publicity: link to personal social media to partially increase creditability for both platform and users in other roles
>>  <li> Marketing outreaching: Exposure and interaction leads to loan coupons or interest advantage
>>  <li> Expands target groups of lender and recommender with customized service: Add charity features, for instance, animal protection association can customize 
>> lend/recommend contract, for people with proof of pets; welfare organization can customize deposit pool for family with more children.
>>   <li> Community reward: Recommenders/lenders in specific pool can support SMEs, customize contract with lower interest plus long-term community rewards, like 
>>   laundry store coupon, bistro discount in the future.
>> </ul>
