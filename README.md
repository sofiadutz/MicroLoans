# MicroLoans

Microloans is a contract for blockchain based peer-to-peer lending. 

<div style="text-align: justify">
The platform will be based on the permissionless and public Ethereum blockchain, making it available to everyone who meets the requirement to enter and produce transactions. The platform is entirely decentralized and transparent for every user who joins the pool. To be more precise, we can resemble our platform with a crowdfunding contract that gives everyone equal access to join and make changes on the chain. 
The aim for this platform is to create an environment where medium/small-sized businesses can afford micro-loans thanks to the peer risk-free network. This, in the historical financial world, has always been avoided, due to high costs and the risks related to the present asymmetries is needed. Clients asking for small, short-term loans have historically been excluded due to the high fixed costs associated with transaction fees and administrative ones. The cost of acquiring clients compared to the size of the loan is drastically higher in microfinance compared to regular commercial loans, and the profits returning from these small transactions, including the acquisition of a customer, don’t compensate for the risks associated with the asymmetries with this practice and the relative costs. The solution we proposed to this problem lays in adopting blockchain, due to the benefits this decision would lend to the platform.

For this reason, we introduced a blockchain solution that focuses on allowing to grant microloans through the consent from previous members who are accountable for the borrower. Indeed, an individual can submit a loan request only through the approval of other 4 members. These act as guarantors and are responsible for the non-repayment of loans of the new entrant, and eventually have to split the loan between them if the borrower defaults. Their deposots are temporarely  Hence, the mechanism of introducing peer pressure through guarantor’s accountability allows requesting loans without providing any collateral.

## Perspectives and future developments: Credit system & Social features

> 1. Automize credit system
>>    <ul>
>>    To motivate active usage and give credit record reference for other financial institutes, credit system could be introduced based on user’s behavior. Rules for example:
>>      <ul>
>>  <li> Collection:
>>    <ul>
>>   <li>Earn credit point after successful loan, for both borrower and recommender </li>
>>    <li>Earn point for sharing MicroLoan activities on social media and for new member invitation</li>
>>    <li>Extra point for being both trustful borrower and responsible recommender</li>
>>    <li>Extra point if accumulated amount and frequency reached certain level​</li>
>>    <li>Extra point if invited members reached certain level of frequent activities</li>
>>    </ul>
>>  <li> Function:
>>    <ul>
>>    <li>Credit points can be used for customer tier identification, and therefore slightly tiered interest pricing, and more payback mode options</li>
>>    <li>In tier groups, adjust loan request priorities, mainly focus on poor credit user in the system</li>
>>    </ul>
>>  <li> Technically:
>>    <ul>
>>    <li>Introduce a new balance for credit points, with functions of plus, minus, cluster into tiers, rank in each tier.</li>
>>    <ul>
 



> 2. Optimize social features
>>    <ul>
>>    Social features could lead to more diverse user groups, and customize their own type of financial aids, either charitable or profit-oriented.
>>      <ul>
>>  <li> Introduce social publicity: link to personal social media to partially increase creditability for both platform and users in other roles
>>  <li> Marketing outreaching: Exposure and interaction leads to loan coupons or interest advantage
>>  <li> Expands target groups of lender and recommender with customized service: Add charity features, for instance, animal protection association can customize 
>> lend/recommend contract, for people with proof of pets; welfare organization can customize deposit pool for family with more children.
>>   <li> Community reward: Recommenders/lenders in specific pool can support SMEs, customize contract with lower interest plus long-term community rewards, like 
>>   laundry store coupon, bistro discount in the future.
>> </ul>
